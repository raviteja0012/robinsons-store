-- Robinsons General Store, production auth and row-level security cutover.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS
-- This file is the deliberate production cutover. It links Supabase Auth to app_user and
-- replaces the dev "anonymous full access" policies with authenticated, per-store, per-role
-- policies. The owner runs it once, after enabling Email auth and creating the owner account.
-- It is intentionally NOT part of schema.sql so the demo keeps its open dev policies until
-- you choose to cut over. schema.sql still ships the dev_all DO-block for the demo.
--
-- ORDER OF OPERATIONS (see RUNBOOK.md "Turn on login"):
--   1. Enable Email auth in Supabase (Authentication, Providers, Email). No public sign-up.
--   2. Create one account per member (Authentication, Users, Add user), each with the SAME email
--      as its app_user row. The demo emails are owner@/manager@/staff@/lead@robinsons.demo.
--   3. Run this whole file in the SQL editor. Section 4 links every account to its app_user row
--      automatically, by email. Re-run it any time you add more accounts (it is idempotent).
--   4. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_AUTH=true in Vercel and redeploy.
--
-- TEST BEFORE TRUSTING: sign in as one owner and one staff and confirm staff cannot read
-- another store's rows and cannot see costs. RLS is only as good as its test.
--
-- This script is idempotent: re-running it drops and recreates the policies and functions.

-- 1. Link auth.users to app_user. Nullable so existing demo rows stay valid until linked.
alter table public.app_user
  add column if not exists auth_id uuid unique references auth.users(id);

-- 1a. The email used to match a Supabase Auth account to its app_user row. Added defensively so
-- this script also works on a database created before email was part of schema.sql.
alter table public.app_user
  add column if not exists email text;

-- 1b. Demo email backfill. Sets the known demo emails on the seeded members only where the email
-- is still null, so auto-linking (section 4) works even if seed.sql was loaded before emails were
-- added. Harmless on a fresh seed (the emails already match) and safe to keep: it never overwrites.
update public.app_user set email = 'owner@robinsons.demo'   where full_name = 'Ravi Kiran'   and email is null;
update public.app_user set email = 'manager@robinsons.demo' where full_name = 'Demo Manager' and email is null;
update public.app_user set email = 'staff@robinsons.demo'   where full_name = 'Demo Staff'    and email is null;
update public.app_user set email = 'lead@robinsons.demo'    where full_name = 'Outpost Lead'  and email is null;

-- 2. Helper functions in a dedicated, safe schema (not public, so they are not exposed as
-- PostgREST RPC by default). They are SECURITY DEFINER and STABLE with a pinned search_path.
-- SECURITY DEFINER lets them read app_user without being subject to RLS, which both avoids
-- recursive policy evaluation (a policy on app_user that needs to read app_user) and keeps
-- the lookup cheap. They key off auth.uid(), the id of the currently signed-in auth user.
