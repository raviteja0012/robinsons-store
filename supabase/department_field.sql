-- Which questions each department's vendor and invoice forms ask, as the owner or a manager
-- chose them on the Department fields screen (src/app/department-fields).
-- Run once in the Supabase SQL editor. Idempotent: safe to run again.
--
-- One row is one tick box: this department, this form, this question, asked or not. A
-- department with no rows asks exactly what the code lists in src/lib/vendorFields.ts and
-- src/lib/invoiceFields.ts say, so an empty table changes nothing on any screen. Rows are
-- only written when somebody changes a box, and a change is an update, never a delete.
--
-- Sections (Clothing, Gifts, Garden Center) have no rows of their own: they follow the
-- department above them, which the app resolves through department.parent_department_id.
--
-- Payment fields are not here. The form check below is the place to add 'payment' when the
-- requester names which payment questions should vary.

-- would fall back to the code lists, and the settings screen could not save. Every member
-- of the store reads the choices, because every form needs them. Only owners and managers
