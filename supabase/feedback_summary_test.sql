-- Proves auth_setup.sql 3g at the database: the AI's description of a suggestion screenshot opens
-- to lead, manager and owner of its store and to the member who attached the screenshot, the same
-- people who may open the screenshot (3f), counting only a file saved by the time the description
-- was; whoever may read one may write it, only for the suggestion it belongs to and the file that
-- suggestion names; nobody removes one; and the suggestion itself carries no description.
-- docs/adr/ADR-005-screenshot-descriptions-follow-the-screenshot.md says why it is built this way.
--
-- Run it on a DISPOSABLE database, never the store's, with the storage schema that Supabase's
-- storage service creates (a local Supabase stack has it):
--   psql "<disposable database>" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f supabase/feedback_summary_test.sql
-- It makes its own two stores, members, suggestions, descriptions and stored-file rows, including
-- rows in auth.users and storage.objects, inside one transaction and rolls every one of them back.
-- It is not in run-order.txt, so the migration workflow never runs it.
--
-- Two kinds of database:
--   enforced login (auth_setup.sql has run): the full role, store and write matrix below.
--   demo (dev_all still open): only that the table is open like every other one.
-- Prints one row per check, then fails with the names of any check that did not pass.
