Read printed text and any handwritten notes or prices written in the margins.
Return ONLY a JSON object, no prose and no code fences, in exactly this shape:

  "invoice_date": string in YYYY-MM-DD or empty string if unknown,
  "notes": string,
  "line_items": [
    {
      "description": string,

      "unit_cost": number,
      "retail_price_note": number or null,
      "confidence": number between 0 and 1
    }
  ]
}
Rules: amounts are in CAD as plain numbers with no currency symbol. retail_price_note is the retail price written by hand next to a line, or null if none. confidence is between 0 and 1; set it low on any field you are unsure about. If a value is missing use 0 for numbers and an empty string for text.`;

// Structured outputs constrain the response to this schema, so "the model wrapped it in a
// code fence" and "the model added a sentence before the JSON" stop being failure modes.
//
// Restrictions worth knowing before editing this (from the structured outputs docs):
// no recursive schemas, no minimum/maximum, no minLength/maxLength, and additionalProperties
// may only be false. That is why the 0-to-1 bound on confidence lives in the prompt above
// rather than here: the schema cannot express it, and a schema the API rejects would fail
// every capture rather than one.
